The Automated Irrigation System project combines Java programming and Arduino hardware to create a smart, event-driven irrigation solution. The system features:

Soil Moisture Monitoring: A moisture sensor continuously measures soil conditions and sends data to the Java application for analysis.
Pump Control: Based on the soil moisture readings, the system activates or deactivates the water pump automatically. It also includes a manual override option via a button for user control.
OLED Display Integration: An OLED display provides real-time feedback on moisture levels and pump status.
Event-Driven Programming: The system uses event listeners to handle sensor inputs and control outputs, ensuring responsive and efficient operation.
Data Visualization: A 2D graph plots moisture levels over time, allowing users to track soil conditions and irrigation patterns effectively.
This project demonstrates expertise in Java, Arduino integration, and real-world application development, showcasing an innovative approach to solving environmental and agricultural challenges.
